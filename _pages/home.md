### Research Focus

Our research spans several key areas in medical AI and computational biology:

- **Medical Image Analysis**: Advanced algorithms for MRI, CT, and microscopy imaging
- **AI for Cancer Diagnostics**: Foundation models for precision oncopathology  
- **Cerebrovascular Modeling**: Network analysis and hemodynamic simulations
- **Brain Connectivity**: Deep learning approaches to structural connectivity analysis
- **Computer-Aided Diagnostics**: Automated systems for clinical decision support

### Open Source Tools

We develop and maintain several open-source software tools:

- **[VascGraph](https://github.com/Damseh/VascularGraph)** - Vascular network segmentation and analysis
- **[VirtualMRI](https://github.com/Damseh/virtualMRI)** - Monte Carlo simulation of MRI responses  
- **[AngioPulse](https://github.com/Damseh/angiopulse)** - Pulsatile blood flow dynamics simulation
